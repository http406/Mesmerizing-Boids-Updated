# Mesmerizing-Boids-Updated
This animation represents a mesmerizing boid simulation. The algorithm follows simple flocking behavior with randomness to create unique patterns. Each boid follows a trajectory, changes direction based on probability, and leaves a glowing trail. Click "Recreate" to generate a new pattern. This update added a soft, glowing watercolor effect behind the main strokes.
